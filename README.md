ReVision: Multimodal Instruction Rewriting with Tiny Vision language Models 
</h1>

## 🛠️ Install

1. Clone this repository and navigate to MobileVLM folder

2. Install Package
    ```Shell
    conda create -n vir python=3.10 -y
    conda activate vir
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dataset

Data is here : https://huggingface.co/datasets/anonymoususerrevision/multimodal_query_rewrites

## Pretrain 
(This step is optional and a pretrained version of the model is already shared in the paper. If you still want to pretrain)
First prepare a model with randomly initialized parameters

    ```Shell
    python prepare_model_for_pretraining.py --vision_model_name_or_path google/siglip-base-patch16-256 --text_model_name_or_path OuteAI/Lite-Mistral-150M-v2-Instruct --dest ./ReVision-250M-64-16-random
    ```

In `pretrain.py`, change the huggingface cache appropriately `os.environ["HF_DATASETS_CACHE"]` and point to your local directoy. Also, if you are planning to push the pretrained model to huggingface hub, change this `anonymoususerrevision/ReVision-250M-64-16` to your desired model identifier. It is strongly advise to thoroughly go through the pretraining code and change variable values as needed. For changing arguments and training hyper parameters, check `args.py`

For pretraining run the following command. 

    ```Shell
    python pretrain.py
    ```
    

## Fine Tune

Similar to pretrainig above, just change code and provide link to the appropriate dataset and run `python finetune.py` (or other variants provided)

## Infernece

Various inference scripts are provided under `test_*.py` and `evaluate.py`. For running baseline experiments with PaliGemma or Qwen, use appropriate processors and conditional generators from huggingface in `evaluate.py` and not use `ReVisionProcessor`, `ReVisionForConditionalGeneration`. Also the format of the prompt needs to be changed (specifically for Paligemma) in `datautils.py`.
